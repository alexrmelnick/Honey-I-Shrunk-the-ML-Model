# Where are the Models?!?

Hello! You are probably wondering why the folder 'Models' doesn't contain any models. This is because the models are too large to be pushed to GitHub. Instead, we have uploaded the models to Google Drive. You can download the models from the following link: [Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1894CT4N6CRRyTfiSWFpon-H0tyVpNO_M?usp=drive_link). Just download the entire folder of the model you want and place the folder in the 'Models' directory. If you are running the models on SCC, the models should already be in the 'Models' folder.
