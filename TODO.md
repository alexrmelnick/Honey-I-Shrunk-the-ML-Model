# TODO List

- Get the model to run on the Teensy board
- Get the Teensy audio hat to record audio
- Get the Teensy to control the display
- Get everything to work together
- Design an inclosure?

## Things we have done

- Quantized the model! To run the quanititization, run `python whisper_quanititization.py`. To run the test inferrence, run `python whisper_inference.py`. 
- Purchased the parts! We have a Teensy 4.1, the Teensy audio board, and the LCD200420x4 I2C Blue display.
